Available parameters
====================
| *Under construction...*
| The following table shows which parameter are available (and tested) separately for each detector type. If ``?``, it means the parameters are available for being plotted but they were not tested (errors could arise).
| The full list of dsp/hit variables that were generated within a given version vXX.YY can be found at legend-login LNGS machine under ``/data1/shared/l60/l60-prodven-v1/prod-ref/vXX.YY/inputs/config/``.
